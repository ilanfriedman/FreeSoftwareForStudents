\* Free trial

&dagger; Only available if your college/university subscribes to the service (most if not all will provide access to this or an alternative)

&sect; Technically part of the Adobe Suite now, but not every college includes it in their plan. But, the software can still be obtained through Substance3D's website. It's a bit of a process to get the newer Adobe versions though so I can probably add a page to this repo to explain if needed.
